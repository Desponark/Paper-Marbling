## How does it work?
All ink drops are made up of a circle of points. Those points get pushed away whenever a new ink drop is added.

For drawing the shapes sfml is used:

More specifically the TriangleFan

## How to use
- Left mouse button to add one ink drop
- Right mouse button to add ink continuously
- Space to add ink randomly
- F to add a border of ink
- Backspace to clear the canvas
